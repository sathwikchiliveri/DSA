Given a positive integer n, count the number of digits in n that divide n evenly (i.e., without leaving a remainder). Return the total number of such digits.

A digit d of n divides n evenly if the remainder when n is divided by d is 0 (n % d == 0).
Digits of n should be checked individually. If a digit is 0, it should be ignored because division by 0 is undefined.
``` python
class Solution:
    def evenlyDivides(self, n):
        original = n
        count = 0
        
        while n > 0:
            lastdigit = n % 10
            
            if lastdigit != 0 and original % lastdigit == 0:
                count += 1
                
            n = n // 10
        
        return count
